# Data Structures and Algorithms 2

# Hash Table - A type of data structures that sends data through a hash function and that hash function returns
# a value that is the location/index that the data will be located. Hash functions typically use the Modulo
# operator. This hash function will take a size and create an array(or other data structure) of that size to store
# the data. Collisions are what happens if to 2 elements have the same return from the hash function. One way to
# handle this is through, the usage of linked list or another data structure that will hold the next value in line,
# in order.

# The objective of this application is to deliver 40 packages that are variable distances apart, and to deliver
# those packages within 140 miles. So the purpose of this hash table implementation will be to ___. But most
# importantly it will sort the internal data by distances from current location.


# The structure that will hold the key and value. also points to the next node if collision happened
